> TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with types. Which is useful if you hate freedom. Some developers say it stops bugs. But so does not writing any code at all. That’s why I use Notepad.

> TypeScript is what happens when JavaScript goes to university and comes back correcting your grammar. It doesn’t make your code better, just more passive-aggressive. Like a spellchecker that judges your life choices.

> React is like the human brain if it forgot everything and rebuilt itself every five seconds. It calls that a “re-render.” Which is ironic, because most people using React can’t remember why their component updated in the first place. It’s evolution—just with more hooks and slightly less survival instinct.
